Parent_Episode_1_Title="Setting the Tone"
Parent_Episode_1_Introduction="Every story has its beginning. Now it's your turn to show how skillful of a ruler you are. Give settlers a place to start a new life and lead the newly formed society. Fail at your job, and you will find no reward for trying."
Parent_Episode_1_Complete="Athens is no longer just an idea. It materialized into a small city under your rule. Now, you must find a way to attract warriors to the city. Copious amounts of wine should do it. You should find suitable land for vast grapevine fields or marble and wood to build a sanctuary of Dionysus."
Parent_Episode_2_Title="Strength in Numbers"
Parent_Episode_2_Introduction="Now that we have expanded our territory, we should build a suitable military to defend it. We will need a lot of bronze from our foundries to turn it into shiny armor. On top of that, elite citizens are known for their fondness of amenities. There have been rumors that some gods have a claim to the land we settled on. Mortal soldiers are of little use against deities. Let's hope that our patron Athena defends us against opponent gods."
Parent_Episode_2_Complete="We grew our military and set aside some drachmas. It should be enough to establish further settlements. Sadly, not everyone is happy with our presence. Our citizens tasted Apollo's wrath. Many have succumbed to ill health after plagues hit our city."

Parent_Episode_3_Introduction="Apollo conspires against us. After a plague hit Sparta, he promised to heal it under one condition - Athens must be razed to the ground. It will not take long for our new adversary to muster its soldiers. We must be ready to defend our city! The only way to make sure we are safe is to conquer Sparta."
Parent_Episode_3_Complete="Sparta is no longer a threat. Apollo vowed revenge after we conquered it. We should be on the lookout for any new dangers."
Parent_Episode_4_Title="The Final Battle"
Parent_Episode_4_Introduction="Our Trojan rivals plot to destroy us! Armies led by a prince hero Hector march towards our city. Our soldiers tremble in fear. Hector is said to be unstoppable.  Thankfully, we summoned Achilles, whose agility is unmatched by any mortal. We must conquer our rivals or the war will never end."
Parent_Episode_4_Complete="The war is over. We mourn those we lost in battles and heal the wounded. Thanks to Athena's intervention god Apollo will no longer haunt us. Our citizens rejoice. After years of bloodshed, we may finally find peace."
