Parent_Episode_1_Introduction="@PTrouble brews beneath the calm blue skies of Hellas. The once-loyal city of Theron, emboldened by new allies across the sea, has turned against your rule. Word has reached your council that Egypt, rich in gold and wisdom, has pledged ships and soldiers to Theron's cause.
@PYour spies report that this alliance is more than trade—it is war. To defend your city and secure peace for the Hellenic world, you must act quickly.
@PBut hope glimmers on the horizon. The fabled people of Atlantis, guardians of ancient power and unmatched naval skill, might be convinced to aid your cause. Their help will not come cheap—they demand an island of their own to settle and protect.
@PRally your allies, Delphos and Mykene, prepare for battle, and secure the allegiance of Atlantis before Theron and the might of Egypt engulf the Aegean in flames.
@PYou are the last line of defense for Greece. Will you rise as its champion?"
